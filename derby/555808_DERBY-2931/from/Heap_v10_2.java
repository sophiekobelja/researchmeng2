/**
 * @format_id ACCESS_HEAP_V2_ID
 *
 * @purpose   The tag that describes the on disk representation of the Heap
 *            conglomerate object.  The Heap conglomerate object is stored in
 *            a field of a row in the Conglomerate directory.
 *
 * @upgrade   The format id of this object is currently always read from disk
 *            as a separate column in the conglomerate directory.  To read
 *            A conglomerate object from disk and upgrade it to the current
 *            version do the following:
 *
 *                format_id = get format id from a separate column
 *                Upgradable conglom_obj = instantiate empty obj(format_id)
 *                read in conglom_obj from disk
 *                conglom = conglom_obj.upgradeToCurrent();
