Changes in Derby 10.0.2.1
    
 *) For Network Server, clear back to appropriate point if
    query fails instead of clearing buffer. (Derby-5)
    [Army Brown <army@golux.com>]

 *) Enable use of functions in triggers (Derby-6)
    [Jack Klebanoff <klebanof@mutagen.net>] 

 *) Triggers do not evaluate functions in VALUES trigger actions. (Derby-14)
    
 *) Method calls on a closed Connection from a PooledConnection no longer
    cause connection closed events to be sent to any listeners.
    Minor clean up of BrokeredConnection as well, remove an unused 
    constructor, make the control field final and remove incorrect comment 
    and unused imports. (Derby-24)
    [Dan Debrunner <djd@debrunners.com>]
    
 *) Connection.close() on a closed connection is defined by JDBC javadoc to 
    be a no-op. (Derby-30)
    [Dan Debrunner]
    
 *) Multiple jvms prevented from booting the same database in parallel to 
    avoid accidental corruptions in Unix environments. (Derby-32)
    [Suresh Thalamati <tsuresh@source-zone.org>]
    
 *) Allow default to be specified for CHAR FOR BIT DATA columns (Derby-34)
    [Satheesh Bandaram <satheesh@sourcery.org>]

 *) Fix dss chaining problems for network server. (Derby-35)
    [Army Brown]
    
 *) LOCKS is no longer a reserved keyword (Derby-38)
    [Mamta Satoor <mamta@remulak.net>]

 *) Allow BIGINT default values in create table. (Derby-40)
    [Satheesh Bandaram]

 *) Encryption key length no longer stored in service.properties. (Derby-42)
    [Sunitha Kambhampati <skambha@Yngvi.Org>]

 *) Enable LIKE ? ESCAPE ? syntax that was disabled before (Derby-44)
    [Satheesh Bandaram]

 *) Allow expressions that result in string types as arguments to a LIKE
    expression (Derby-45)
    [Satheesh Bandaram]

 *) Make RETAIN a non-reserved keyword (Derby-54)
    [Satheesh Bandaram]
    
 *) Faster create database by moving DatabaseMetaData SPS creation into the 
    DataDictionary. Means creation of these statements is not logged and 
    compilation is delayed until the matching DatabaseMetaData method is 
    first called.
    [Dan Debrunner]
    
 *) dblook argument handling has been improved. Bad arguments now generate 
    an error, and connection URLs in quotes are handled properly.
    [Jalud Abdulmenan <tendi@rogers.com>]
    
 *) Localization of dblook messages enabled.
    [Satheesh Bandaram]
    
 *) Extension Packaging:
       1. The monitor is changed to read multiple module.properties files,
          using method ClassLoader.getSystemResources.
       2. The monitor reads sub-sub-protocol properties from the
          modules.properties files, instead of just the system properties.
       3. Sub-sub-protocol property values can name either a StorageFactory
          or a PersistentService implementation. Previously it could only
          name a StorageFactory implementation.
    [Jack Klebanoff]

 *) Latent bug fixed in org.apache.derby.impl.store.access.sort.ExternalSortFactory. 
    Its canSupport method throws an exception if it is called with a null 
    startParams argument.
    [Jack Klebanoff]
    
 *) Prevent empty log switches by rechecking the conditions that trigger the
    log switched in synchronized blocks, and make backward scans skip the 
    empty log files. In multi-threaded application when many threads are 
    executing commits in parallel, empty log files might be created.
    Recovery log scan does not expect empty log files while scanning log
    records to undo incomplete transactions.
    [Suresh Thalamati] 
    
 *) Add derby.war file
    [Kathey Marsden <kmarsden@sourcery.org>]
    
 *) Fix display of NetServlet messages. 
    [Lynh Nguyen <lynhnn@remulak.net>]

 *) Database Metadata now returns correct size for maximum column name
    length, maximum schema name length, etc.
    [Satheesh Bandaram]

 *) Add static property derby.drda.keepAlive to Network Server, to set the
    use of TCP keepalive for Network Server connections on the server side,
    with the use of keepalive on by default.
    [Kathey Marsden]

 *) Ensure BrokeredStatement and PreparedStatement always throw a Statement
    is closed exception if the statement is closed.
    [Dan Debrunner]
