  SUMMARIZE THE ISSUE. This is a one line summary of the issue.

  For instance:

  Applications may no longer open two InputStreams on the same ResultSet column.
-->


<h4>Summary of Change</h4>

<p>
Security enhancements to the Network Server may slow down Derby's runtime performance, and
      they may trigger SecurityExceptions when Derby executes user-written
      functions and procedures.
</p>


<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS THAT THE USER ACTUALLY SEES WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS.

  For instance:

  In the previous release, applications were able to open two
  InputStreams on the same column. Depending on how these streams
  interacted, the value siphoned out of the column was erratic. Now
  Derby raises a SQLException when the application attempts to create
  the second InputStream.
-->


<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
Startup performance for networked applications may degrade after upgrading to 10.3. In addition,
      after upgrade, user-written functions and procedures may raise SecurityExceptions.
</p>

<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH PREVIOUS RELEASE, IF ANY.

  For instance:

  Applications which open two InputStreams on the ResultSet column now
  fail.
-->


<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>

<p>
In previous releases, the Network Server booted without
installing a default security
      manager. Now, the Network Server
      installs a security manager if the user forgets to. Application
      startup may slow down as the security manager performs initial access
      checks on Derby tables. Once all user tables have been touched,
      the application should reach steady state and the drag induced
      by the security manager should be negligible.
</p>


<p>
In addition, SecurityExceptions may occur if user-written functions
      and procedures perform sensitive operations such as
      reading/writing files and getting/setting system properties.
</p>


<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior
  is correct.
-->


<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
In a client/server configuration, it is particularly important to
      protect against other users' mistakes and hacking. Derby is enhancing
      security for this configuration.
Now if you neglect to configure a Java security
      manager, the Network Server attempts to install its own security
      manager with a default policy.
</p>


<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE HOW TO REVERT TO THE PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR OR
  OTHERWISE AVOID THE INCOMPATIBILITIES INTRODUCED BY THIS CHANGE.

  For instance:

  Users must recode applications which open multiple streams on the same column.
-->


<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>

<p>
SecurityExceptions can be avoided by installing your own security
      manager with your own policy file, which grants the appropriate
      privileges to your user-written code. Instructions on how to do
      this can be found in the Derby Developer's Guide in the section
titled "Running Derby under a security manager" and in the
Derby Server and Administration Guide in the section titled
"Running the Network Server under the security manager".
</p>


<p>
If for some reason this is not practical, or if the startup
      performance drag is intolerable, then you can instruct the
      server to not install a security manager. You do this by booting
      the server with the "-noSecurityManager" command line option as
      explained in above-mentioned section of the Derby Server and Administration Guide.

<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>


<p>
In the previous release, Blobs and Clobs were sometimes usable even
      after the transaction ended or the connection was closed. Now Blobs
      and Clobs are not usable after these events.

<p>
Now Blobs and Clobs store their data in temporary files.
These temporary files are deleted when the transaction ends.
The Blob.free() and Clob.free() methods also delete these temporary files.
This erases the transient state of these large objects and makes them
unusable.

  Derby raises a SQLException when the application attempts to create

-->

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>Applications which use the explicit JOIN ... ON syntax to perform
joins between three or more FROM expressions, at least one of which is
a view, subquery, or other non-base table expression, may have been
seeing incorrect results prior to this release.<br>

</p>

<p>As an example, take the following:<br>

</p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"> create table t1 (c0
int);<br>
 create table x (c1 int, c2 int);<br>
 create table t2 (c3 int, c4 int);<br>

<br>
 insert into t1 values 1;<br>
 insert into x values (0, 1);<br>
 insert into t2 values (0, 2);</span>

</p>

<p>With these tables, the following query should return one row, but
was returning zero rows in previous releases:<br>

</p>

<p>
<span style="font-family: monospace;"> select t1.* from</span>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">
t1 JOIN (select * from x) vw(c1,c2) ON (t1.c0 = vw.c2)</span>
<span style="font-family: monospace;">
JOIN t2 ON (vw.c1 = t2.c3)<br>

</span>

-->

<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>

<p>
The fix for the bug shown above does not introduce any functional
incompatibilities. However, applications may now see different
results if they happen to use queries that rely on the JOIN ... ON
syntax to
join with views, subqueries, or other non-base table expressions. </p>
<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior
  is correct.
-->

<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>Due to an error in column reference mappings, it was possible for
earlier versions of Derby
to confuse ON predicate column references with each other, thereby
leading to incorrect computation of transitive closure. This in
turn could lead to the addition of invalid predicates to the query,
which caused wrong results in certain cases.<br>

</p>

<p>By fixing this bug we ensure that the affected queries will always
return the correct results.<br>

</p>

<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>

<p>
No application changes should be needed.<br>

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
In the previous release(s), using the builtin timestampdiff function using the SQL_TSI_FRAC_SECOND for the datepart parameter would return an integer overflow error except with very small intervals, less then a second, because the result would exceed the range of an INT.
For intervals larger than a second, SQL_TSI_SECOND had to be used. Now, the result type has been changed to BIGINT and so one can use intervals &gt; 1 sec with SQL_TSI_FRAC_SECOND.
However as a result of the change SQL functions that take the result of the timestampdiff function as a parameter of datatype INT will no longer be resolved.

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
Applications which specify set operations inside of an EXISTS predicate
may have been seeing incorrect results for such queries. For
example, the following query should return a single row with column
"OK":
</p>


<pre>
select * from ( values 'OK' ) as T where exists (values 1 except values 2)
</pre>


<p>Prior to Derby 10.3, though, that query would incorrectly return
zero rows.
</p>
<!-- 
  OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE INCOMPATIBILITIES WITH PREVIOUS RELEASE, IF ANY.

  For instance:

-->

<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>

<p>
Prior to Derby 10.3 a user could specify "SELECT *" within an EXISTS
predicate's set operation and Derby took the "*" to be a single
column. As a result, some queries would compile and execute
without error even when they should have failed. As an example,
the following query would succeed even if table T2 had more than one
column:
</p>


<pre>
select * from ( values 'OK') as T where exists
   (select i from T1 union select * from T2)
</pre>


<p>As of version 10.3 Derby no longer allows this. Changes
to fix the incorrect query results make it so that the above query will
now throw an error (42X58) if T2 has more than one column, because then
the left and right result sets of the union would not have the same
number of result columns.
</p>
<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior
  is correct.
-->

<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
Due to the way in which Derby internally handles result columns within
an EXISTS predicate, it was possible for queries having EXISTS
predicates with set operators to return incorrect results. By
internally rewriting the EXISTS subquery when it is a set operator, we
can ensure that Derby now evaluates such predicates correctly.
For more on the details of the rewrite, see DERBY-2370.
</p>

<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>

<p>

</p>

<p>As a result of the new internal rewrite, any "*" that appears within
the EXISTS set operation will now be properly expanded. This
means that applications which specify set operations inside of an
EXISTS predicate
must now ensure that the result sets to which a given set operation
applies have the same number of result columns. See the
"incompatibilities" section above for details. No other
application changes are required.</p>

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>The functionality is new for ClientDataSources. Previously, applications
      could not call these methods. Now these methods work:
</p>

<blockquote>

<ul>

<li>setCreateDatabase (String) </li>

<li>getCreateDatabase() </li>

<li>setShutdownDatabase (String) </li>

<li>getShutdownDatabase() </li>

</ul>

</blockquote>


<p>
These methods should behave similarly to the ones in Embedded, i.e.
only valid value for setCreateDatabase is "create", and for
setShutdownDatabase is "shutdown". In essence, at connection time, if
set to a valid value, the property is passed on to the server side with
the ConnectionAttributes.<br>
Note, that the result for setting contradicting properties for
createDatabase and ShutdownDatabase, whether through
setCreateDatabase("create") and setShutdownDatabase("shutdown") or via
setConnectionAttributes("create=true") or ("shutdown=true") is
undefined.

<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
With version 10.2.1.6 an incompatibility with 10.1.1.0 was introduced -
since revision 393003, the undocumented, non-standard but
previously public method, getProperties for Client DataSources was
removed for security reasons. This left only the
setConnectionAttributes method available for creating or shutting down
a database, and caused hardship for applications that had previously
taken advantage of the getProperties method. For instance, in Geronimo
the getProperties method was
previously used to inquire and set whether a create=true was set for a
database.<br>
Support for the four methods already existing for EmbeddedDataSource
was requested for ClientDataSource to compensate for the disappearance
of getProperties as a public method.

<p>
In release 10.2, any authenticated user would be able to:
<ul>
  
<li>Shut down the database.</li>
  
<li>Encrypt a previously unencrypted database.</li>
  
<li>Re-encrypt an encrypted database with a new bootPassword or a
    new encryption key.</li>
  
<li>Perform a full (as opposed to soft) upgrade of the database from
  a previous version.</li>

</ul>
In 10.3, if both authentication and sqlAuthentication are enabled, an
application which tries to perform any such operation by connecting as
any user other than the <i>database owner</i>, will see an
SQLException with SQLState "08004" and the operation will not be
performed.
</p>

<p>
The check on full upgrade pertains to upgrades from 10.2.* (and
subsequent) releases of Derby only.  When upgrading from 10.0 or 10.1
any valid user can still do the full upgrade. This user then becomes
the database owner. The reason for this difference is that the
database owner concept was first introduced in 10.2. Note that once
you upgrade, the database owner can not be changed.

<p>

<b>Note:</b> The database owner is identical to the authorization
identifier (i.e. user name) used when the database was created or user
name used when upgrading from 10.0 or 10.1 as the case may be. If the
database was created or upgraded <i>without</i> supplying a user name
(authentication not enabled) the database owner defaults to "APP".

Instead of relying on the default policy installed by the Network
      Server, the user should further limit the scope of privileged operations.
In particular, the
      user should fine-tune the blanket read/write privilege granted
      on the entire server file system. The user should narrow this
      privilege to just the directories needed for backup/restore,
      import/export, and jar file loading.
For instructions on how to refine the policy file, please consult
      the Derby Server and Administration Guide section titled
"Customizing the Network Server's security policy".
</p>


<p>
This is also an opportunity for the user to enable user authentication
      if the Network Server currently runs without
      authentication. Running in a client/server configuration without
      authentication exposes the application and the server machine to
      many threats. It is strongly discouraged. For instructions on enabling
      user authentication, please consult the Derby Developer's Guide
      section titled "Working with user authentication".

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

With JVMs/OSs that support the functionality, such as JDK version 1.4.2 and up on Solaris, a performance improvement may be noticed. On other platforms, no change may be noticeable.

</p>


<!-- 
  DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior
  is correct.
-->


<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>

<p>
For writing the transaction log to disk Derby uses a RandomAccessFile. Before this change, if it was supported by the JVM, the log files were opened in "rws" mode making the file system take care of syncing writes to disk. "rws" mode ensured that both the data and the file meta-data was updated for every write to the file. On some operating systems (e.g. Solaris) this lead to two write operations to the disk for every write issued by Derby. This was limiting the throughput of update intensive applications. By changing the file mode to "rwd" the number of updates to the disk is reduced. 

Some JVMs have a bug in the support for "rws" and "rwd" mode. Derby will check for this bug, and if it is detected, Derby will revert back to using "rw" mode and print an appropriate message indicating this in derby.log.

<h4>Application Changes Required</h4>

<p>
No changes are needed or possible to benefit from this change. If your JVM supports it, it will be used. If Derby detects that your JVM has a bug in the support for "rwd", a message will be printed to derby.log:<br>
------------ BEGIN ERROR MESSAGE ------------- <br>
LogToFile.checkJvmSyncError: Your JVM seems to have a problem with implicit syncing of log files. Will use explicit syncing instead. <br>
------------ END ERROR MESSAGE ------------- <br>

-->

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
The Derby documentation indicates that if the 'ALL' keyword is not
specified when using a set operator, the default behavior is to remove
duplicate rows from the result. There is, however, a specific
type of query in which previous versions of Derby would incorrectly
include duplicate rows, even if "ALL" was not specified. The
queries in question have all of the following characteristics:<br>

</p>

<ol>
  
<li>A chain of two or more set operators appears in the FROM list of
a SELECT query; <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span>
<br>
  
</li>
  
<li> There exists at least one nested set operator in the chain which:<br>
a) is *not* the top-level set operator in the chain, and<br>
b) which does *not* include "ALL"; <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span>
</li>
  
<li>The result of the set operator from #2 includes duplicate rows; <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span>
</li>
  
<li>None of the set operators which sit above the set operator from
#2 in the query tree removes duplicates.<br>
  
</li>

</ol>

<p>A query which satisfies all of these conditions would return
incorrect results (duplicate rows) in previous releases. Consider
the following simple example:<br>

</p>

<span style="font-family: monospace;"> create view vw(i) as
values 1, 2 union values 2 union all values 3;<br>

<br>
 -- Both of the following queries are equally affected by this
issue.<br>

<br>
 select * from vw;<br>
 select * from (values 1, 2
union values 2 union all values 3) x</span>
<br>

<p>In this example the chain of unions is as follows:</p>

<p style="font-family: monospace;">

<pre>
              union_1 all
             /           \
         union_2        values 3
         /      \
   values 1, 2   values 2
</pre>

</p>

<p>Note that <span style="font-family: monospace;">union_2</span> is
nested within <span style="font-family: monospace;">union_1</span>,
and that <span style="font-family: monospace;">union_2</span> has
duplicate values ("2"). Also note that <span style="font-family: monospace;">union_1</span> has an "ALL" specified
and thus does not remove duplicates. So we've satisfied the above
criteria and we would expect that, since <span style="font-family: monospace;">union_2</span> does not have the "ALL"
keyword, the duplicate "2" rows should be removed before evaluation of <span style="font-family: monospace;">union_1</span>. But in previous
releases of Derby this removal of duplicates did not happen. Thus
the query would incorrectly return four rows, with the value "2" being
duplicated.<br>

</p>

<h4>Incompatibilities with Previous Release</h4>
The fix for the bug shown above does not introduce any functional
incompatibilities. However, applications may see different
results if they happen to use queries which satisfy the conditions
outlined above. Such applications may also see slightly increased
execution times for the relevant queries due to the fact that Derby
internally sorts the nested results to remove duplicates.<br>

<p>While it is true that a Derby SQL TIME value has by definition
resolution of only a second, the java.sql.Time class is not a direct

java.sql.Time class has a precision of milliseconds. So when
retrieving a java.sql.Time value from an SQL TIMESTAMP, Derby should
retain the millisecond precision.<br>

<p>
In a number of usage cases of setNull(int, int) and set*(int, null, int) methods for PreparedStatement and CallableStatement, Derby's Client implementation has been changed, to correctly behave in the same way as the Embedded implementation.

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
In a number of method calls involving null values for PreparedStatement and CallableStatement, Derby's Client implementation behaved differently from the Embedded implementation.
Now, in most cases, the Client returns an error where Embedded returns an error and succeeds where Embedded succeeds.
For instance:
<ol>

<li>setNull(LONGVARCHAR) on parameter of type CHAR FOR BIT DATA (Types.BINARY).
In previous releases, Embedded returned an error (SQLState 22005), but the Client did not. Now, both Embedded and Client will return an error.</li>

<li> setNull(LONGVARBINARY) on parameter of type CHAR FOR BIT DATA (Types.BINARY).
In previous releases, this call succeeded with Embedded, but the Client returned an error (SQLState 22005). Now, such a call will succeed with both Embedded and Client.</li>

<li> setNull(LONGVARBINARY) on parameter of type VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA (Types.VARBINARY).
In previous releases, the call succeeded with Embedded, Client returned an error (SQLState 22005). Now, such a call will succeed with both Embedded and Client.</li>

<li> setNull(BINARY) on parameter of type LONG VARCHAR FOR BIT DATA (Types.LONGVARBINARY).
In previous releases, such a call succeeded with Embedded, but Client returned an error (SQLState 22005). Now, such a call will succeed with both Embedded and Client.</li>

<li> setNull(TIME) on parameter of TIMESTAMP.
In previous releases, Embedded returned an error (SQLState 22005), but the Client did not. Now, both Embedded and client will return an error.</li>

</ol>
Similar differences existed with the set&lt;type&gt;(int, null) calls.<br>
Note, that where an error is returned, the actual SQLState returned may still be different between the two implementations.

specification. Blob and Clob now support all the methods of JDBC 3.0 and 4.0.</p>




<!-- DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS THAT THE USER ACTUALLY SEES WHEN THE PROBLEM OCCURS.

  For instance:

  In the previous release, applications were able to open two
  InputStreams on the same column. Depending on how these streams
  interacted, the value siphoned out of the column was erratic. Now
  Derby raises a SQLException when the application attempts to create
  the second InputStream.
-->


<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>


<p>Existing application won't be effected by it as these methods are
new implementations. Applications won't be getting Not Implemented
exception anymore.</p>




<!-- DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

  For instance:

  The previous behavior violated the JDBC standard. The new behavior
  is correct.

<h4>Rationale for Change</h4>


<p>To support all the methods in Blob and Clob introduced in the latest JDBC Specification.<br>


<br>



</p>


<!-- OPTIONAL: DESCRIBE HOW TO REVERT TO THE PREVIOUS BEHAVIOR OR
  OTHERWISE AVOID THE INCOMPATIBILITIES INTRODUCED BY THIS CHANGE.

  For instance:

<h4>Symptoms Seen by Applications Affected by Change</h4>

<p>
Previously, if you ran "java org.apache.derby.tools.sysinfo -cp client SimpleApp.class" you got a message indicating that the DB2 JCC driver was not found in your classpath, even though you had the Derby Client library in your classpath.
Now "-cp client" only checks for the presence of the Derby client.
To check for the presence of the DB2 JCC driver jar, you can pass the new "-cp db2driver" argument.

<p>Network Client:  Locator-based implementation of Blob/Clob

<FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif">Memory requirements for handling

<LI>Stream access to Blob/Clob values:  Streams obtained to read
	from Blob/Clob objects (E.g., Blob.getBinaryStream()), would in
	previous releases not reflect any changes made to the object after
	the stream was created.  In Derby 10.3, it is unpredictable what a 
	read operation on a stream will see of changes made between the
	creation of the stream and the time of the read operation.  This
	means that applications that interleaves reads and writes of a
	Blob/Clob object may observe a changed behavior.</LI>

<!-- DESCRIBE WHY THE CHANGE WAS MADE.

-->Rationale
for Change</h4>

<p>
<FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif">In earlier versions of the Derby
Network Client, Blob and Clob operation caused the entire objects to
be materialized in memory.  For large values, this  required large
amounts of memory on the client side.  To reduce the resource usage,
a locator-based scheme has been implemented.  The JDBC driver will
hold references to server-side Blob/Clob values, and use these
references to request the server to perform operations on the values.
 Hence, the Network Client will no longer need large amounts of
memory too materialize large values in memory.</FONT>
</p>

<p>
<FONT FACE="Thorndale, serif">The incompatibilities are introduced
because it was difficult to maintain the previous behavior when the
Blob/Clob objects are no longer materialized in memory.</FONT>

-->Application
Changes Required</h4>

<p>Applications that  access Blob/Clob objects after the transaction
they were created in has committed need to be changed.  Make sure
that the commit of the transaction is delayed until the objects are
no longer needed.  This means that if the same object is to be used
in several statements, these statements will have to run in the same
transaction (i.e., auto-commit may not be used in such cases).  Also
note that if auto-commit is used, a transaction will be committed
when the result set is closed.  Hence, when using auto-commit one
must delay the closing of the result set until the Blob/Clob objects
are no longer needed.</p>
