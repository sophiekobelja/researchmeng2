# This file contains the extra list of the files to be included
# with Derby's public JDBC3 api but not with the public JDBC4 api.
# This list supplements the common list found in
# publishedapi.ant.
# 
# IMPORTANT: all names should be like package names, but with slashes
#            instead of dots.
#
# Add new files to the appropriate package section; add new sections
# for new packages.
#
# IMPORTANT: if you are adding a new package, be sure to add it to
#            the list of packages in the publishedapi target in
#            the toplevel build.xml file.
#
# Please do not add whitespace in front of class names.
# Blank lines and comments are allowed.
