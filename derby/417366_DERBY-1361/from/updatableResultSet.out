Got expected exception DELETE on table 'TABLEWITHPRIMARYKEY' caused a violation of foreign key constraint 'FK' for key (1,1).  The statement has been rolled back.
Since autocommit is on, the constraint exception resulted in a runtime rollback causing updatable resultset object to close
Jira entry Derby-160 : for Network Server because next should have failed
FAIL!!! next should have failed because foreign key constraint failure resulted in a runtime rollback
Negative Test14 - foreign key constraint failure will cause updateRow to fail

doing positioned update again w/o positioning the RS will succeed
because the cursor is still positioned
Position the ResultSet with next()
Should still be able to do positioned update
Positive Test2 - even if no columns from table specified in the column list, we should be able to get updatable resultset
Will work in embedded mode because target table is not derived from the columns in the select list
Will not work in network server mode because it derives the target table from the columns in the select list

Positive Test5 - donot have to select primary key to get an updatable resultset
column 1 on this row is 1
now try to delete row when primary key is not selected for that row
Positive Test6a - For Forward Only resultsets, DatabaseMetaData will return false for ownDeletesAreVisible and deletesAreDetected
This is because, after deleteRow, we position the ResultSet before the next row. We don't make a hole for the deleted row and then stay on that deleted hole
ownDeletesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
othersDeletesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? true
deletesAreDetected(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
The JDBC program should look at rowDeleted only if deletesAreDetected returns true
Since Derby returns false for detlesAreDetected for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultset,the program should not rely on rs.rowDeleted() for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultsets
Have this call to rs.rowDeleted() just to make sure the method does always return false? false
Positive Test6b - For Forward Only resultsets, DatabaseMetaData will return false for ownUpdatesAreVisible and updatesAreDetected
This is because, after updateRow, we position the ResultSet before the next row
ownUpdatesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
othersUpdatesAreVisible(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? true
updatesAreDetected(ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY)? false
The JDBC program should look at rowUpdated only if updatesAreDetected returns true
Since Derby returns false for updatesAreDetected for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultset,the program should not rely on rs.rowUpdated() for FORWARD_ONLY updatable resultsets
Have this call to rs.rowUpdated() just to make sure the method does always return false? false
Positive Test7a - delete using updatable resultset api from a temporary table
following rows in temp table before deleteRow
	 C21,C22
	 --- ---
	{21,1}
	{22,1}
As expected, no rows in temp table after deleteRow
	 C21,C22

following rows in temp table before deleteRow
	 C31,C32

	{22,1}
As expected, updated rows in temp table after updateRow
	 C31,C32
	 --- ---
	{123,1}
	{123,1}
Positive Test8a - change the name of the statement when the resultset is open and see if deleteRow still works
This test works in embedded mode since Derby can handle the change in the name of the statement with an open resultset
But it fails under Network Server mode because JCC and Derby Net Client do not allow statement name change when there an open resultset against it
change the cursor name(case sensitive name) with setCursorName and then try to deleteRow
change the cursor name one more time with setCursorName and then try to deleteRow
SQL State : X0X95
Got expected exception Operation 'setCursorName()' cannot be performed on object 'Statement' because there is an open ResultSet dependent on that object.
Positive Test8b - change the name of the statement when the resultset is open and see if updateRow still works
This test works in embedded mode since Derby can handle the change in the name of the statement with an open resultset
But it fails under Network Server mode because JCC and Derby Net Client do not allow statement name change when there an open resultset against it
change the cursor name one more time with setCursorName and then try to updateRow
change the cursor name(case sensitive name) with setCursorName and then try to updateRow
SQL State : X0X95
Got expected exception Operation 'setCursorName()' cannot be performed on object 'Statement' because there is an open ResultSet dependent on that object.
Positive Test9a - using correlation name for the table in the select sql works in embedded mode and Network Server using Derby Net Client driver
Correlation name for table does not work in Network Server mode (using JCC) because the drivers construct the delete sql with the correlation name rather than the base table name
column 1 on this row is 1
now try to deleteRow
PASS!!! passed in embedded mode
Positive Test9b - using correlation name for updatable columns is not allowed.
Table t1 has following rows
	 C1,C2

Positive Test10 - 2 updatable resultsets going against the same table, will they conflict?
delete using first resultset
attempt to send deleteRow on the same row through a different resultset should throw an exception
SQL State : XCL08
Got expected exception Cursor '<xxx-cursor-name-xxx>' is not on a row.
Move to next row in the 2nd resultset and then delete using the second resultset

Notice the Fetch Size in run time statistics output.
