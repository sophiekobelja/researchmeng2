<overview>

<p>
The most up to date information about Derby releases can be found on the
<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/derby_downloads.html">Derby download page</a>.
</p>

<p>
Apache Derby is a pure Java relational database engine using standard SQL and
JDBC as its APIs. More information about Derby can be found on the
<a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">Apache web site</a>.
Derby functionality includes:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Embedded engine with JDBC drivers</li>
<li>Network Server</li>
<li>Network client JDBC drivers</li>
<li>Command line tools: ij (SQL scripting), dblook (schema dump) and sysinfo (system info)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Java and JDBC versions supported:
<ul>
  <li>Java SE 1.4 and higher with
    JDBC 2.1, 3.0, 4.0 and 4.1</li>
  <li>Java ME CDC/Foundation Profile 1.1 with
    JSR-169 JDBC Optional Package for CDC/Foundation Profile.</li>
</ul>
</p>
</overview>

<newFeatures>

<p>
This is a feature release. The following new features were added:
</p>

<ul>

<li><b>JDBC 4.1</b> - Derby's JDBC drivers support the new Java 7 methods on the <i>java.sql</i> and <i>javax.sql</i> interfaces. This support works with
the pre-GA OpenJDK 7 build 131 available at http://download.java.net/jdk7/ on March 3, 2011. Derby's implementation of these interfaces may
change in a future release in the highly unlikely event that the actual GA version of these interfaces changes.</li>
	
<li><b>Automatic calculation of index statistics</b> - Derby automatically refreshes statistics to help it pick better query plans.</li>
	
<li><b>Improved interrupt handling</b> - Interrupting connection threads no longer crashes the Derby engine.</li>
	
<li><b>MAX optimization</b> - On indexed tables, MAX queries run faster in more cases.</li>

<li><b>XML operator portability</b> - The xmlparse and xmlserialize operators work out-of-the-box on more platforms.</li>

</ul>

</newFeatures>

    These are the instructions for verifying the signed distributions. Probably you
    won't need to touch this section.

<releaseVerification>

<p>It is essential that you verify the integrity of the downloaded
files using the PGP and MD5 signatures.  MD5 verification ensures the
file was not corrupted during the download process.  PGP verification
ensures that the file came from a certain person.</p>

<p>The PGP signatures can be verified using
<a href="http://www.pgpi.org/">PGP</a> or
<a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GPG</a>.
First download the Apache Derby
<a href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/db/derby/code/trunk/KEYS">KEYS</a>
as well as the <code>asc</code> signature file for the particular
distribution. It is important that you get these files from the ultimate
trusted source - the main ASF distribution site, rather than from a mirror.
Then verify the signatures using ...</p>

<pre>
% pgpk -a KEYS
% pgpv db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% pgp -ka KEYS
% pgp db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

<em>or</em>

% gpg --import KEYS
% gpg --verify db-derby-X.Y.tar.gz.asc

</pre>

<p>To verify the MD5 signature on the files, you need to use a program
called <code>md5</code> or <code>md5sum</code>, which is
included in many unix distributions.  It is also available as part of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html">GNU
Textutils</a>.  Windows users can get binary md5 programs from <a
href="http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/">here</a>, <a
href="http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console/">here</a>, or
<a href="http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/">here</a>.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you verify your downloads with both PGP and MD5.</p>
