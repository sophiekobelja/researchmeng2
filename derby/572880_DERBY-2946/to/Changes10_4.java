/**
 * Upgrade test cases for 10.4.
 * If the old version is 10.4 or later then these tests
 * will not be run.
 * <BR>
    10.4 Upgrade issues

    <UL>
    <LI> testMetaDataQueryRunInSYScompilationSchema - DERBY-2946 
    Make sure that metadata queries get run with SYS schema as the current 
    compilation schema rather than a user schema as the current compilation 
    schema. This is because if the user is inside a user schema in a collated 
    database and if the meta data query gets run inside the user schema, then 
    we will run into collation mismatch errors for a subclause like following 
    in the WHERE clause.
    P.SELECTPRIV = 'Y' 
    The reason for error is that the left hand side of the = operation will 
    have collation type of UCS_BASIC because that column belongs to a table 
    from system schema. But the collation type of the right hand will be 
    territory based if the current compilation schema is user schema. But if 
    the current compilation schema is set to SYS schema, then right hand side 
    will also have collation of UCS_BASIC and hence there won't be any 
    collation mismatch. 
    Background info : character string constants pick up the collation of the
    current compilation schema. 
    </UL>
