# excluding resultsetStream.java because this test uses java.io.FileInputStream throughout the test
# excluding TestErrorStreamTarget.java since it's not relevant for clients
# excluding statementJdbc20.java because this tests fetch_reverse throughout the test
# excluding jdbcapi/testRelative.java because this is a new test contributed by Shreyas Kaushik and needs to be debugged with JCC  in order to get it running with network server
# excluding jdbcapi/SetQueryTimeoutTest.java because neither the JCC driver nor the ClientDriver support setQueryTimeout() yet.
# excluding jdbcapi/rsgetXXXcolumnNames.java as it fails incorrectly, according to JDBC spec. Forwarding test case to JCC team.
# excluding jdbcapi/statementJdbc30.java - Client behaves differently. Need to look into this
#           regardless of framework
# excluding largedata/LobLimits.java to run with the network server because currently lobs are materialized and this test tests for 2G lobs.
