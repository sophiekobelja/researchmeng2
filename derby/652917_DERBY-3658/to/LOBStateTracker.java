/**
 * An object that tracks the state of large objects (LOBs) in a result set.
 * <p>
 * This object covers two types of functionality regarding LOBs;
 * <ul>
 *      <li>Keep track of whether a LOB column has been accessed.</li>
 *      <li>Release LOB locators on the server.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The former functionality is always present in a tracker object. The latter
 * functionality may or may not be available. This is decided by whether
 * locators are supported by the server or not.
 * <p>
 * The tracker has a notion of current row. The current row is changed by
 * calling {@link #checkCurrentRow checkCurrentRow}. The owner of the tracker
 * is repsonsible for invoking the method at the correct time, and only when
 * the cursor is positioned on a valid data row. The method must be invoked
 * before the cursor changes the position. Note that calling the method
 * {@link #discardState discardState} makes {@code checkCurrentRow} ignore all
 * LOBs on the subsequent call.
