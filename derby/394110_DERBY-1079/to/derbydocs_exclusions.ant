# This file contains a list of the files that do not go into our
# javadoc currently. These are files which can only be compiled
# on jdk 1.6. When we fully support jdk 1.6 we can prune
# these exclusions.
#
# Add new files to the appropriate package section; add new sections
# for new packages.
#
# IMPORTANT: if you are adding a new package, be sure to add it to
#            the list of packages in the publishedapi target in
#            the toplevel build.xml file.
#
# Please do not add whitespace in front of class names.
# Blank lines and comments are allowed.
