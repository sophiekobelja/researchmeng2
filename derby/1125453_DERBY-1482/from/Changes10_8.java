    /**
     * Changes made for DERBY-1482 caused corruption which is being logged 
     *  under DERBY-5121. The issue is that the generated trigger action
     *  sql could be looking for columns (by positions, not names) in
     *  incorrect positions. With DERBY-1482, trigger assumed that the
     *  runtime resultset that they will get will only have trigger columns
     *  and trigger action columns used through the REFERENCING column.
     *  That is an incorrect assumption because the resultset could have
     *  more columns if the triggering sql requires more columns. DERBY-1482
     *  changes are in 10.7 and higher codelines. Because of this bug, the
     *  changes for DERBY-1482 have been backed out from 10.7 and 10.8
     *  codelines so they now match 10.6 and earlier releases. This in 
     *  other words means that the resultset presented to the trigger
     *  will have all the columns from the trigger table and the trigger
     *  action generated sql should look for the columns in the trigger
     *  table by their absolution column position in the trigger table.
     *  This disabling of code will make sure that all the future triggers
     *  get created correctly. The existing triggers at the time of 
     *  upgrade (to the releases with DERBY-1482 backout changes in them)
     *  will get marked invalid and when they fire next time around,
     *  the regenerated sql for them will be generated again and they
     *  will start behaving correctly. So, it is highly recommended that
     *  we upgrade 10.7.1.1 to next point release of 10.7 or to 10.8
