Project Status

  Description

  "Derby" began as a snapshot of the IBM's Cloudscape Java relational database. IBM
  contributed the code to The Apache Software Foundation and 
  bases future versions of IBM Cloudscape on the Apache-managed code.

  To participate in Derby, you should join the mailing list. Just 
  send an empty message to derby-dev-subscribe@db.apache.org.

  Derby graduated from incubation in July, 2005 and is now a
  full-fledged Apache DB project..

Project info

  * The Apache DB project owns the Derby subproject, and the subproject
    follows the Apache DB PMC's direction. Significant contributors to this sub-
    project (for example, after a significant interval of sustained
    contribution) will be proposed for commit access to the codebase.

  * The Derby sub-project's modules will be available as distinct and discrete downloads.

Identify the codebase

date        item
2004-08-30  If applicable, make sure that any associated name does not already
            exist and check www.nameprotect.com to be sure that the name is not
            already trademarked for an existing software product.
DONE        If request from an existing Apache project to adopt an external
            package, then ask the Apache project for the cvs module and mail
            address names.
DONE        If request from outside Apache to enter an existing Apache project,
            then post a message to that project for them to decide on 
            acceptance.
N/A         If request from anywhere to become a stand-alone PMC, then assess
            the fit with the ASF, and create the lists and modules under the
            incubator address/module names if accepted.

Copyright

date        item
2004-08-26  Check and make sure that the papers that transfer rights to the ASF
            been received. It is only necessary to transfer rights for the
            package, the core code, and any new code produced by the project.
2005-01-10  Check and make sure that the files that have been donated have been
            updated to reflect the new ASF copyright.

Verify distribution rights

date        item
2004-10-12  Check that all active committers have a signed CLA on record.
2004-10-12  Remind active committers that they are responsible for ensuring that
            a Corporate CLA is recorded if such is is required to authorize
            their contributions under their individual CLA.
2004-10-12  Check and make sure that for all items included with the
            distribution that is not under the Apache license, we have the right
            to combine with Apache-licensed code and redistribute.
2004-10-12  Check and make sure that all items depended upon by the project is
            covered by one or more of the following approved licenses: Apache,
            BSD, Artistic, MIT/X, MIT/W3C, MPL 1.1, or something with
            essentially the same terms.

Establish a list of active committers !

status  item
DONE    Check that all active committers have submitted a contributors
        agreement.
DONE    Add all active committers in the STATUS file.
DONE    Ask root for the creation of committers' accounts on cvs.apache.org.

Infrastructure !

status	item
DONE	Ask infrastructure to create source repository modules and grant the
        committers karma.
DONE    Ask infrastructure to set up and archive Mailing lists.
DONE    Decide about and then ask infrastructure to setup an issuetracking
        system (Bugzilla, Scarab, Jira).
DONE    Migrate the project to our infrastructure.

Generally, the result of checking off these items will be a Software Grant, CLA,
and Corporate CLA for ASF licensed code, which must have no dependencies upon
items whose licenses that are incompatible with the Apache License.

Licensing awareness

DONE - Are all licensing, trademark, credit issues being taken care of and
       acknowleged by all committers?

[VOTE] Re-vote for Derby docs in DITA format

  Jeff Levitt called for a vote to to decide whether to use DITA source files

  connect to the Derby Network Server.

  Passed with nine +1 votes.

[VOTE] Network client driver should match embedded where possible for
       implementation specific behaviour.

  Marsden called for a vote to agree that the client driver behavior should be
  changed to match the embedded wherever possible.
