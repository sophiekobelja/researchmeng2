Project Status

  Description

  "Derby" began as a snapshot of the IBM's Cloudscape Java relational database. IBM
  contributed the code to The Apache Software Foundation and 
  bases future versions of IBM Cloudscape on the Apache-managed code.

  To participate in Derby, you should join the mailing list. Just 
  send an empty message to derby-dev-subscribe@db.apache.org.

  Derby graduated from incubation in July, 2005 and is now a
  full-fledged Apache DB project..

Project info

  * The Apache DB project owns the Derby subproject, and the subproject
    follows the Apache DB PMC's direction. Significant contributors to this sub-
    project (for example, after a significant interval of sustained
    contribution) will be proposed for commit access to the codebase.

  * The Derby sub-project's modules will be available as distinct and discrete downloads.

Releases from trunk:

 * 10.2.0.0 : In development 
 * 10.1.1.0 : Released 8/3/2005
 * 10.0.2.1 : Released 12/06/2004

  Kathey Marsden voted -1 if the proposal meant that jdbc clients

  implementation will address this concern and clients will see
  these columns correctly typed as BOOLEAN.
