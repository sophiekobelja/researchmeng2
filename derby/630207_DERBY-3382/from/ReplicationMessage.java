/**
 * This message is used for the communication between the master and the
 * slave during Replication. The message is composed of a type flag
 * and corresponding object. Each type flag indicating the type of the 
 * content bundled inside the message.
 *
 * For now the following message types are defined
 *
 * TYPE_LOG - This flag will be used for all messages will carry LogRecords.
 * TYPE_ACK - this flag is used to send a acknowledgment of successful
 *            completion of a requested operation. It will however not
 *            be used to signify reception for every message transmission
 *            since tcp would automatically take care of this.
 * TYPE_ERROR - Indicates that the requested operation was not able to be
 *              completed successfully.
 * TYPE_INITIATE - used during the intial handshake between the master and
 *                 the slave. The initial handshake helps to negotiate the
 *                 message UIDs and send a appropriate error or acknowledgment.
