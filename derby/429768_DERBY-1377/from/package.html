Useful constants that the Java compiler will in-line.
A collection of reference interfaces that contain primitive or
String constants. Such constants will be in-lined by the Java
compiler hopefully leading to smaller footprint, than a reference
to a field entails. Fields in interfaces are automatically public,
static and final, hence constants.
<P>
These classes should not need to be shipped with any of the Derby jar files.
If one is shipped with a Jar file then it most likely means the field
representing the constant was a non-String Object (e.g. new Integer(1))
or the final field is a calculated value that could not be resolved
to a constant by the Java compiler.
